Go stuff

- Avoid the syscall package. It's deprecated.
- Prefer the os package over golang.org/x/sys/... where possible to avoid cross
  platform implementation pain.
- It may be easier to use C naming conventions for internal code?
- A good implementation will need a very good byte buffer pool.


Fuse specific notes
- Every request has {id, uid, gid, pid, nodeid, opcode}. Do we want to make this
  generally available/exposed?
- Will we get better perf characteristics from a blocking or non-blocking fd?
- Can locks be handled opaquely, or must they be exposed?
- Stat structs vary across OS implementations. Commonality?
