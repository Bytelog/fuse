Project
- Document not just how to use our library, but provide a much needed guide on
  how each fuse API call should be implemented.
- Provide a "TraceFS" implementation?


Go stuff

- Avoid the syscall package. It's deprecated.
- Prefer the os package over golang.org/x/sys/... where possible to avoid cross
  platform implementation pain.
- It may be easier to use C naming conventions for internal code?
- A good implementation will need a very good byte buffer pool.
- Use go style errors, not syscall numbers. Keep it idiomatic.


Fuse specific notes
- Every request has {id, uid, gid, pid, nodeid, opcode}. Do we want to make this
  generally available/exposed?
- Will we get better perf characteristics from a blocking or non-blocking fd?
- Can locks be handled opaquely, or must they be exposed?
- Stat structs vary across OS implementations. Commonality?
